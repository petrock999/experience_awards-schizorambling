going to the bench and looking at the sea and the people and remembering that in the future is a checkpoint that you can fall back on; that's karma - actions in the past bring consequences or memory material in the future/present

songs help with this checkpoint building, a song i listened in the past brings me back to that time in the present

so fill your life with checkpoints, as banal as they might be
